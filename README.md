  - Allow users to map their recipes manually in a monthly and a weekly calendar;
  - Allow users an option to map their meals automatically, based on pre-selected preferences; (e.g.: meat 2 times per week, fish 4 days per week, vegetarian all the missing meals)
  - Recipe creation and selection through a repository;
